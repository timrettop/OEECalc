# OEE Calculator üìä
OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) Calculator is a simple **Android application** designed for the manufacturing industry to calculate **Availability, Performance, and Quality** and determine the **OEE percentage**.

## Features
-  Calculate OEE based on planned production time, operating time, total count, good count, and ideal cycle time.

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose**
- **Material 3 UI**
- **Firebase (if applicable)**

## üîß Installation & Setup
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
- Android Studio **Giraffe (2023.3.1)+**

- Gradle **8+**
- An Android device or emulator running **Android 8+ (API 26+)**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/timrettop/OEECalc.git
cd OEECalc
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Open in Android Studio
1.  Open Android Studio.
2.  Click "Open an Existing Project" and select the OEECalc folder.
3.  Wait for Gradle Sync to complete

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the App
1.  Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run** in the top-right corner of the screen.

## How OEE is calculated
OEE = Availability √ó Performance √ó Quality

Where:
- Availability = (Operating Time) / (Planned Production Time)
- Performance = (Ideal Cycle Time √ó Total Count) / (Operating Time)
- Quality = (Good Count) / (Total Count)
